# Extension Architecture and Boot Sequence

- Content script entry: [`src/entrypoints/content/index.tsx`](mdc:src/entrypoints/content/index.tsx)
  1. Inject main-world script [`url-monitor-main-world.ts`](mdc:src/entrypoints/url-monitor-main-world.ts)
  2. Start `urlMonitor` then `chatChangeDetector`
  3. Mount UI with `createIntegratedUi` and `renderOverlay`
- Main-world responsibilities:
  - Override `history.pushState/replaceState` and dispatch `GEM_EXT_EVENTS.URL_CHANGE`
  - Never read or mutate React UI here; only emit navigation events
- Isolated world responsibilities:
  - Subscribe to URL change events via [`urlMonitor`](mdc:src/services/urlMonitor.ts)
  - Coordinate services and mount the Shadow DOM UI overlay

## Events
- Event constant: [`GEM_EXT_EVENTS.URL_CHANGE`](mdc:src/common/event.ts)
- Prefer the global event bus for cross-module events (see event bus rule)

## Do / Don’t
- Do: Inject main-world script before starting services that depend on navigation
- Do: Use `createIntegratedUi` for UI mounting and keep a very high `z-index`
- Don’t: Directly patch `history` from isolated world; always go through main world
