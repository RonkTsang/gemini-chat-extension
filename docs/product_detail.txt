Ever get lost scrolling through a long Gemini conversation, trying to find that one specific prompt? Chat Outline for Gemini is a simple, elegant solution designed to bring effortless navigation to your chats.

It adds a minimal, unobtrusive icon to the Gemini page. Hover over it, and a clickable outline of your entire conversation history appears, allowing you to instantly jump to any point in the discussion.

Key Features:
  👀 Instant Overview: Get a bird's-eye view of all your prompts in the current chat.
  ☝️ One-Click Navigation: Simply click on any prompt in the outline to navigate directly to it. No more endless scrolling.
  📌 Pinned Mode: Keep your chat outline always visible for instant access.
  ✨ (NEW!) Quick Follow-up: Quickly quote a specific part of a message to ask a follow-up question. It's incredibly efficient.
  🍃 Lightweight & Clean: Designed to be minimal and out of the way, keeping your workspace clean and focused. 

A Fun Fact: 
This extension was a passion project, co-created with Gemini itself! I used Gemini to help write and refine the code, making this a tool for Gemini, by Gemini (and a developer).

Stop scrolling, start navigating. Add Chat Outline to your browser and streamline your workflow today!
