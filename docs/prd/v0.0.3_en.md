**Title:** Implement "Quick Quote" Feature for Message Content

## **Background:**
In conversations with the Gemini AI, the model may provide lengthy text and a large amount of information. Users often want to ask follow-up questions about a specific part of the response. This feature provides a shortcut to quickly select text and ask a follow-up question.

## **Detailed Logic:**
1.  Listen for text selection events within the model's response area (all `<message-content />` elements).
2.  When a user selects a piece of text, an elegant, interactive tooltip button with the text "Ask Gemini" should appear above the mouse cursor upon selection release. The position should default to the cursor's location at the end of the selection, with edge detection to prevent it from going off-screen.
3.  When the user clicks the "Ask Gemini" button, the button should disappear, and a hidden text snippet should be inserted into the user input field. The input field should then be focused. Refer to the following structure (the input field's DOM structure is provided at the end):

    ```html
    <p style="display: none; user-select: none; pointer-events: none;" id="gemini-fake-content">
      Referring to this in particular: {user's selected content}
      <br/>
    </p>
    ```
4.  Simultaneously, a UI element (the "Quote Status UI") should be inserted above the input field to indicate that the user is currently quoting the selected content. This UI should consist of:
    *   A quote indicator icon.
    *   The original quoted text.
    *   A small close button on the right: Clicking this will remove the "Quote Status UI" and the hidden text from the input field.
5.  If the user does not click the "Ask Gemini" button and instead clicks anywhere else on the page, the tooltip button should disappear.

## **Supplemental DOM Structures:**

1.  The model's response will have the following DOM structure. Note that there can be multiple `<model-response>` elements under `<chat-window>`, which increase as the chat progresses.
    ```html
    <chat-window>
      <model-response>
        <div>
          <response-container>
            <div class="response-container">
              <div class="presented-response-container">
                <div class="response-container-content">
                  <div class="response-content">
                    <!-- Model's Response -->
                    <message-content />
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </response-container>
        </div>
      </model-response>
    </chat-window>
    ```

2.  Input Field DOM Structure:
    ```html
    <input-container>
      <!-- Multiple levels omitted -->
      <xxx> 
        <rich-textarea>

          {Quote Status UI}

          <div class="ql-editor ql-blank textarea new-input-ui" data-gramm="false" contenteditable="true" role="textbox" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Enter a prompt here" data-placeholder="Ask Gemini">
            <!-- Position where the hidden text is inserted -->
            {Hidden Text}
          </div>
        </rich-textarea>
      </xxx>
    </input-container>
    ```
