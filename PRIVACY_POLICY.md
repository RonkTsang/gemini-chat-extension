# Privacy Policy for Chat Outline for Gemini

**Last Updated:** August 02, 2025

Thank you for using Chat Outline for Gemini ("the Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension does and does not collect from you.

## 1. No Data Collection

The Extension is designed with user privacy as a core principle.
The Extension is designed to run entirely on your local computer (client-side). **We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal data**.

This includes:
-   Your Google account information.
-   Your Gemini chat history, prompts, or responses.
-   Your IP address or any other network information.
-   Any other data from your browser or computer.

## 2. How the Extension Works

The Extension operates by reading the content of the active Gemini webpage in your browser to generate the chat outline. This process happens locally on your machine and the data is never sent to any external server or service.

## 3. Permissions

The Extension requires minimal permissions to function, specifically to access the content on `gemini.google.com` pages. This permission is solely used to create the outline and for no other purpose.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the Extension's functionality changes. Any updates will be posted on this page.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
